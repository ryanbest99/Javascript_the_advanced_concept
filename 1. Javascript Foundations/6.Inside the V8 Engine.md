# Inside the V8 Engine

## Let's have a look at the pros and cons of each

### Interpreters:

- Quick to get up and running

- There's no compilation step before we can start running our code.
- Because of this an interpreter is a natural fit for something like Javascript.
- Javascript file get sent from the server to the browser to the client on the front end
- We want that JS to execute right away. Because our users are gonna be waiting on the web page trying to interact with our application.
- Javascript was created for browsers.
- So being able to interpret JS and run it asap, that was an ideal

### This is why JS used interpreters at the beginning

### But there's a con with using an interpreter

- Googlemaps: Running a lot of JS, it will get slower

- for example if yoou're in a loop, it can get slow.

## The compiler helps us here

- It takes a little bit more time to start up, because it has to go through that compilation step at the beginning

- Compiler can simplify the code instead of calling the function multiple times

- Because a compiler doesn't need to repeat the translation for each pass through, the code is faster.

- and these sort of edits that compilers do are called **OPTIMIZATION**

## Is there a way that we can get the best of both worlds?

### This is V8 engines comes in:

- Combine these two and create **JIT**(Just In Time) Compiler

## Let's see how V8 engine works underneath the hood
